"""Pygame Polygons

A Pygame Application done to build more Pygame applications / games
Basically I needed a tool that would easily make me able to draw shapes / Polygons on a Pygame screen and be able to
quickly see the vertices x,y coordinates.

Because you can also move the polygons around, this provide a good way to test and get move draw quick into a new
Pygame project where drawing polygons is needed, because it shows you the coordinates on the screen.



Todo:
    * 1) Show press buttons
    * 2) Button Rotate
    * 3) Show button keybords and mouse movements
    * 4) ABle to 'draw' with a canvas (like paint)
    * 5) Make database (SQLite or simple JSON?=
    * 6) Load from database
    * 7) Save from database

Fixme:
    * 1) Add 'vertices' button is broken. see tag 'FIXME_IS_BROKEN'
